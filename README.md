1. Absoltue precision. Explaining driving directions to a friend can be done quite simply using time and distance, and minor mistakes may not be detrimental. In programming there is no luxery of room for error.

2. Machine code is written as huge numerical lists for a CPU to comprehend as opposed to source code being a plain text bridge between human language and machine code. The closer to machine code(low level languages) the more difficult it is to write. You lose running speed when using higher level languages.

The CPU is the brain of the computer. It interprets and executes the data contained in programs 

Instructions and Data are stores in memory, such as RAM(random access memory).

3. Integrated Development Environments. 
Its a large program bundled with a good programmers text editor as well as many other features for professional development. Text editors in general are a huge help and time/effort saver, for example syntax checking.

4. Mid to high level compiled language. 
It is useful for device specific application development because if you know what machine you are running on it allows for faster speeds, and of course it isnt cross platform.

We wouldnt want interpreted for iphone and ipad apps because it is often slower, and source code is public.
